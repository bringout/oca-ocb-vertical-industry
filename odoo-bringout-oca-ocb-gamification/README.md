# Gamification


Gamification process
====================
The Gamification module provides ways to evaluate and motivate the users of Odoo.

The users can be evaluated using goals and numerical objectives to reach.
**Goals** are assigned through **challenges** to evaluate and compare members of a team with each others and through time.

For non-numerical achievements, **badges** can be granted to users. From a simple "thank you" to an exceptional achievement, a badge is an easy way to exprimate gratitude to a user for their good work.

Both goals and badges are flexibles and can be adapted to a large range of modules and actions. When installed, this module creates easy goals to help new users to discover Odoo and configure their user profile.
